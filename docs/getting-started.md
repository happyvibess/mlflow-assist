# Getting Started with MLFlow-Assist üöÄ

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with MLFlow-Assist, even if you're new to Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Let's break it down into simple steps.

## What Can MLFlow-Assist Do For You? üéØ

Think of MLFlow-Assist as your AI development assistant that helps you:

1. **Build ML Models Automatically** ü§ñ
   - Find the best model for your data without being an expert
   - Optimize model performance automatically
   - Handle all the technical details for you

2. **Work with Language Models Easily** üó£Ô∏è
   - Use GPT and other language models without complex setup
   - Create conversation chains
   - Process text in multiple steps

3. **Deploy and Monitor Everything** üìä
   - Put your models into production
   - Track how well they're performing
   - Get alerts if something needs attention

## Quick Start Examples üí°

### 1. Building Your First ML Model

```python
from mlflow_assist import AutoML, AutoMLConfig

# Create your AI assistant
automl = AutoML(AutoMLConfig(
    task_type="classification",  # Tell it what type of problem you're solving
    metric="accuracy"           # What's important to measure
))

# Let it find the best model for your data
best_model = automl.optimize(X_train, y_train)

# Use your model
predictions = best_model.predict(new_data)
```

### 2. Using Language Models (Like GPT)

```python
from mlflow_assist import LLMHandler

# Create your language model helper
llm = LLMHandler(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Ask it questions
response = llm.generate(
    prompt="Explain what machine learning is in simple terms",
    max_length=100
)

print(response)
```

### 3. Creating a Conversation Chain

```python
from mlflow_assist.advanced.llm_chains import LLMChain

# Create a chain of operations
chain = LLMChain("gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Set up a series of steps
pipeline = chain.create_chain([
    {"template": "Summarize this: {text}"},
    {"template": "Extract main points from: {text}"},
    {"template": "Explain these points to a beginner: {text}"}
])

# Run your chain
results = pipeline.execute({
    "text": "Your long text here..."
})
```

## Common Use Cases üìö

1. **Data Classification**
   - Customer segmentation
   - Email spam detection
   - Image recognition

2. **Text Processing**
   - Summarizing documents
   - Answering questions
   - Generating content

3. **Automation**
   - Automated report generation
   - Data analysis
   - Content moderation

## Practical Tips üí™

1. **Starting Out**
   - Begin with a small dataset
   - Use the AutoML feature first
   - Start with simple classification tasks

2. **Working with LLMs**
   - Start with basic prompts
   - Use templates for consistency
   - Build chains step by step

3. **Monitoring**
   - Always monitor your model's performance
   - Set up alerts for important metrics
   - Keep track of usage costs
